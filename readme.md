# Multi chain AMM

## Website
a demo website: https://multi-chain-amm.vercel.app/

## Project Description
This project is an AMM built on Solana because of its instant and affordable transactions.

But to mimic the UX of normal Central Exchanges, we need to add more chains to the AMM. the whole logic of trading is being handled on solana but deposits and withdrawals are being handled by <b>Wormhole<b>

## Project Details
- The project is built on Solana
- Withdrawals and deposits from chains other than Solana are handled by Wormhole
- To demonstrate a simple AMM we have created a dummy amm on solana. code can be found here: `programs/multi-chain-amm/src/lib.rs`

## Additional Information
- The project is still in development phase
